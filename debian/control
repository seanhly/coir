Description: An individually fair re-ranker for search results.
 This package provides a C++ implementation of greedy, individual fairness, as
 proposed by Biega, Gummadi and Weikum (2018).

 The program runs as a daemon, listening for requests on a named pipe and
 writing responses to a separate directory of named pipes.  A reference client
 (coir-client) is included with this package; this client probes the daemon
 using the expected protocol.
